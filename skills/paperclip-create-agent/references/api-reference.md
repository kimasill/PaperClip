## `POST /api/companies/:companyId/agent-hires`

Request body matches agent create shape:

```json
{
  "name": "CTO",
  "role": "cto",
  "title": "Chief Technology Officer",
  "icon": "crown",
  "reportsTo": "uuid-or-null",
  "capabilities": "Owns architecture and engineering execution",
  "desiredSkills": ["vercel-labs/agent-browser/agent-browser"],
  "adapterType": "claude_local",
  "adapterConfig": {
    "cwd": "/absolute/path",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    "promptTemplate": "You are CTO..."
  },
  "runtimeConfig": {
    "heartbeat": {
      "enabled": true,
      "intervalSec": 300,
      "wakeOnDemand": true
    }
  },
  "budgetMonthlyCents": 0,
  "sourceIssueId": "uuid-or-null",
  "sourceIssueIds": ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"],
  "managedInstructionFiles": {
    "AGENTS.md": "Optional: task-specific AGENTS body written by the hiring agent. Merged on top of `onboarding-assets/<role>/` defaults so you can omit HEARTBEAT/SOUL/TOOLS and keep repo templates for those files."
  }
}
```

`managedInstructionFiles` is accepted on **`agent-hires`** and **`POST .../agents`** create. Keys must be basenames ending in `.md` (e.g. `AGENTS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`). It is **not** stored on the agent row; it only seeds the first managed bundle materialization.

Response:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "pending_approval"
  },
  "approval": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "hire_agent",
    "status": "pending",
    "payload": {
      "desiredSkills": ["vercel-labs/agent-browser/agent-browser"]
    }
  }
}
```

If company setting disables required approval, `approval` is `null` and the agent is created as `idle`.

`desiredSkills` accepts company skill ids, canonical keys, or a unique slug. The server resolves and stores canonical company skill keys.

## Approval Lifecycle

Statuses:

- `pending`
- `revision_requested`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `cancelled`

For hire approvals:

- approved: linked agent transitions `pending_approval -> idle`
- rejected: linked agent is terminated

## Safety Notes

- Config read APIs redact obvious secrets.
- `pending_approval` agents cannot run heartbeats, receive assignments, or create keys.
- All actions are logged in activity for auditability.
- Use markdown in issue/approval comments and include links to approval, agent, and source issue.
- After approval resolution, requester may be woken with `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` and should reconcile linked issues.
